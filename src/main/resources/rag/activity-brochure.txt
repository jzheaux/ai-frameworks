- Iconic heart sculptures that rotate throughout the year.  
- Shopping options range from souvenirs to high-end brands.

## 2. Hop on a Cable Car (5-minute walk to the Powell & Market turnaround)
San Francisco’s historic cable cars are a **must-do** for first-time visitors. Yes, you’ll likely stand in line (especially for the Powell & Market route), but it’s totally worth it to ride up and down the city’s famous hills.

**Approx. Cost:** Around \$8 each way (discounts may apply for youth).  
**Why It’s Cool:**  
- You’ll get postcard-worthy views from the open-air sides.

**Why It’s Cool:**  
- Amazing vantage point for photos of the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz.  
- A bit of exercise (heads up: there are some steep stairs!).

## 9. Catch Golden Gate Bridge Views (Public transit or ~4-mile walk)
While you can certainly walk all the way (be prepared: it’s about an **80-minute** walk), it might be more practical to hop on a bus or rideshare with your chaperone’s permission. Once there, strolling partway across the **Golden Gate Bridge** is an unforgettable experience.
